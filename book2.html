  <h2> THE PLOT  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüêç</h2> </div>
  <div id="tabletwo">
  <p> While spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old<b> Harry Potter </b>is visited by a house-elf named Dobby. He warns that
     Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses,
     so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. A furious Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his room in retaliation. 
     The Ministry of Magic immediately sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts.
     <br>
     

    Ron Weasley and his brothers, Fred and George, arrive in their father's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to the Weasley home.
     Harry and the entire Weasley family travel to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and meet <b>Lucius Malfoy</b>, 
     father of Harry's nemesis <b>Draco</b>, and also Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is the new Defence Against 
     the 
     Dark Arts professor. </p><p>At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron are unable to enter Platform 9¬æ and miss the Hogwarts Express. 
     They fly in Mr Weasley's car to Hogwarts, crashing into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's hand-me-down wand.
      The car then escapes into the forest.</p>
      <br>
      
    
   <p> Harry learns that some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior.
     Harry is the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified
     , along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware". It is believed that 
     Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students.
      The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.</p>
      <br>
      
    
   <p> During a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the 
    hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry there, and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber
     of Secrets was once opened years before. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry spontaneously
      exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue', the language of snakes.</p>
      
      <br>
   <p> Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione secretly brews Polyjuice Potion, 
    allowing Harry and Ron to impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile,
     Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her stall. It belonged to <b>Tom Riddle</b>, a student
      who witnessed another student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's consciousness within the diary claims to Harry 
      that Hagrid was responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus 
      Dumbledore is forced out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison.</p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
    Following instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest. They encounter a gigantic 
    Acromantula named Aragog, which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron
     to its progeny, but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that Hermione had deduced that the monster is a basilisk ‚Äì a
      gigantic snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a reflection. Harry concludes the basilisk is the voice in the
       walls and that it travels through the plumbing. He also realises Moaning Myrtle was the student that was killed.</p>
    
    <p>Ron's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the entrance in Myrtle's
     bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with them. Lockhart confesses he is a magically incompetent fraud and attempts to erase the boys' 
     memories using Ron's damaged wand. The spell backfires, obliterating his own memory and causes a rockfall, separating Ron and Harry.
     <br>
     <br>
    
    Harry proceeds to the Chamber and finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals that 
    he is     <b> Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin</b>     .He previously opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid.
     He has been using the diary to possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. He then
      unleashes the basilisk. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes
       blinds the basilisk and Harry pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat. He slays 
       the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry.
        Harry stabs Riddle's diary with a basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle, and reviving Ginny.</p>
        <br>
        
    
    <p>Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore, who is curious about it.
         Lucius Malfoy bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and 
         was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron when in Diagon Alley to 
         open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but 
         Dobby magically deflects him.
         <br>
         
    
    The petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. 
    Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.</p>
