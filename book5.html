            <p><b>Harry Potter</b> and his cousin Dudley Dursley are attacked by two <b>Dementors,</b> but Harry manages to drive the Dementors off
                 with a<i><u>Patronus charm.</u></i>
                 Shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Magic detect the act of underage wizardry and attempt to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts 
                 immediately, 
                 but this is modified to a trial later in the summer.</p><p></p> After experiencing horrible nightmares depicting the evil Lord Voldemort's 
                 return, Harry 
                 is awoken by the arrival of an advance guard of wizards who escort him to the headquarters
                 of the<b><u></u> Order of the Phoenix</b></u>, a secret organization founded by Dumbledore. </p><p>It is only now that Harry discovers that 
                    under the Ministry's 
                 influence the newspaper <b>the Daily Prophet</b> has launched a smear campaign against anyone who claims that Voldemort has returned, 
                 leaving Harry 
                 feeling isolated and betrayed by the Wizarding community.</p>
                 <p> Harry and the other members of the Order fly to 12 Grimmauld Place, the home of 
                 <i>Sirius Black</i>, where they meet with<b> Sirius, Remus, Ron, Hermione </b>and others.
                  Later, Ron and Hermione express concern about Harry's situation 
                 with the Ministry.</p>
<p>
                Harry and Arthur Weasley head to the court where Harry's trial will take place, briefly spotting <b>Lucius Malfoy </b>
                speaking with the minister 
                on their way. With the help of Dumbledore and Harry's neighbour, Mrs Figg, 
                Harry is cleared of all charges at the Ministry and is allowed 
                to return to Hogwarts</p>
                <p>. However, during Harry, Ron and Hermione's fifth year at Hogwarts School, the Minister for Magic <b>Cornelius Fudge</b> appoints
                 a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, <i>Dolores Umbridge</i>, a Senior Ministry official who refuses to 
                 teach practical magic to her students, as the Ministry fears Dumbledore will organize his own personal wizard army.
                  One day during class, Harry is punished for claiming that Cedric Diggory was killed by Voldemort, which according 
                  to the Ministry's official policy is a lie. In Umbridge's office, Harry is forced to write <b>"I must not tell lies"</b> 
                  repeatedly as punishment.</p>
                  <p> However, the sentence is magically imprinted on his hand instead, causing scarring. Meanwhile, as 
                   Umbridge's control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret defence group, 
                   calling themselves<b><u> "Dumbledore's Army"</u></b> or DA for short.
                    Harry, Ron and Hermione start teaching at Hogwarts, training students in defensive spells to become part of the Army</p>
                    . <p>Draco Malfoy and other Slytherin students are then recruited by Umbridge to try to uncover the secretive group, c
                        reating the <u><i>Inquisitorial Squad</u></i>.</p>
                        <p> <b>Meanwhile, Harry officially begins a relationship with Cho, as they kiss one day after training. </b></p>
                           <p> In an attempt to tighten her oppressive grip on Hogwarts, Umbridge dismisses 
                           <b> Professor Sybill Trelawney </b>and tries to have her banished from Hogwarts,
                            which is only prevented after Dumbledore's intervention.</p>
                
               <p> Harry's nightmares continue, including a dangerous attack upon<b> Arthur Weasley</b> in the Department of Mysteries
                 involving <b>Nagini</b>, Lord 
                Voldemort's snake, which
                 happens to turn true. Harry's anger starts to get out of control, as his mental connection to Voldemort grows 
                stronger. Fearing Voldemort will exploit his connection with Harry, 
                Dumbledore immediately instructs <b>Professor Snape</b> to give Harry a crash 
                course on <b>Occlumency</b> lessons in an attempt to block Harry's mind from the Dark Lord's influence.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, <b>Bellatrix Lestrange</b> escapes from Azkaban along with other Death Eaters after one of the prison walls is
                     damaged by lightning flashes</p>
                <p>. At Hogwarts, Umbridge, Filch and her loyal Inquisitorial Squad, uncover Dumbledore's Army after interrogating one of the students, Cho Chang
                 for whom Harry had developed intense feelings. Dumbledore is questioned and makes an impressive escape as Fudge orders his arrest.
                  With Dumbledore gone, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress, and her sinister dominance over the school continues. Later, Hagrid introduces 
                  Harry, Ron and Hermione to his half-brother giant, Grawp. Later, Harry reverses Snape's spell by glimpsing into Snape's mind. It is then that Harry learns that Harry's father used to bully Snape when they were students at Hogwarts, which appears to be the real cause behind Snape's resentment towards Harry. Meanwhile the Weasley twins, Fred and George formulate a plan of their own.
                </p>
                <p>During an O.W.L. exam, the Weasley twins execute their plan, launching a firework display in the great hall causing 
                    chaos for Umbridge, Fudge 
                and the students of Slytherin house. As the students cheer joyously outside, Harry suffers a vision of Sirius trapped within the bowels
                 of the
                 Ministry being interrogated about the Order. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to search for Sirius, but Umbridge, soon after, 
                 catches the trio 
                 attempting to use the Floo Network, and begins interrogating Harry. She calls for Professor Snape to bring Veritaserum for
                  use during her
                  interrogation, as she has for all of her previous interrogations, but Snape tells her that the supply has been exhausted</p>
                  <p>. Hermione then 
                  tricks Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest along with Harry and her in search of a faux weapon, really leading her to the hiding 
                  place of Grawp who has since freed himself from the tree he was latched to, when a herd of centaurs, who have their own
                   issues with the 
                  Ministry, emerge and carry the Headmistress into the darkness. Hermione and Harry head back to Hogwarts to find Ron
                   and other DA members, 
                  Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, and Ginny Weasley, the group decided to fly to London by way of the Thestrals
                   (winged horse-like magical
                   creatures) to the Department of Mysteries of London City in an attempt to save Sirius.</p>
                   <p>
                
                The six enter the Department of Mysteries, where they uncover a prophecy involving Harry and Voldemort, but are soon ambushed by
                 Death Eaters, including <b>Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange</b>, Sirius's deranged cousin.
                  After a brief battle and a failed escape 
                 attempt, the Death Eaters, manage to take Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, and Ginny as hostages threatening to kill them if Harry does 
                 not hand over the prophecy. Sirius appears, with the other members of the Order of the Phoenix, and attacks the Death Eaters causing 
                 Lucius to drop the prophecy, which then shatters. A battle erupts as the Death Eaters try to stop the students from escaping, resulting 
                 in Sirius's death at Bellatrix's hand. Back in the Atrium, Harry corners Bellatrix, where he struggles with his desire to enact the Cruciatus
                  curse. Voldemort himself appears, ready to kill Harry when Dumbledore emerges to face his battle against Voldemort.</p>
                <p>
                A brief but furious duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore takes place, in which Bellatrix escapes through the Floo Network.
                 When Voldemort disappears, and the battle seems over, Harry suddenly finds himself possessed by Voldemort -- recalling images
                  of his past, of his family and his friends but throws off Voldemort's influence, stating that he is stronger
                   than Voldemort through his friends and his ability to love. Ministry officials, including
                    Fudge, hastily arrive via the Floo Network moments before Voldemort disappears.</p>

                <p>
                In the aftermath of the battle, the Ministry is forced to end their smear campaign and Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts, 
                awaiting
                 a formal investigation. Dumbledore explains that he had attempted to distance
                  himself from Harry all year, hoping it would lessen 
                 the risk of Voldemort discovering and using the connection between the two. While the students head home from Hogwarts at the end of 
                 the academic year, Harry
                  tells his friends that they have one thing Voldemort does not:<b><u> love, a power worth fighting for</u> </b>.</p>
